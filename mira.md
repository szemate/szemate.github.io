### Homework for 1 May

1. Watch [CrashCourse Computer Science Episode 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l26oaHV7D40) on
YouTube. It's very dense and packed with information, don't worry if you don't understand
everything, this is all that we're going to learn in the next couple of months. (If you find the
teacher speaking too fast, subtitles are available.)
2. Install a few applications:
    - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for running the Python programs we're going to
      write. Make sure to download the 3.x version.
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is a version control system to save and share your work
      easily.
    - [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a programmers' text editor that is easy to learn.
    - [GitAhead](http://gitahead.scitools.com/) is a graphical user interface for Git that is easy
      to learn. It's free for non-commercial use (don't click 'buy'.)
    - [cmder](http://cmder.net/) is a console for running commands. It's enough to download the mini
      version.
3. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account so that we'll be able to work on the same project
together.
